    <p>A tortured soul of deep sentiment who was a prolific poet who legacy was mostly consumed
        by fire in a family incident. In tribute to the legacy of my great uncle and too immortalized a bit of
        his soul I present in this site his remaining poems. He was considered the Brazilian symbolist who had in
        his poetry one of the greatest lyrical qualities of the country in his time.</p>


    <p>Considered by José Alfonso Mendonça Azevedo "our Verlaine", Edgar Mata (1878-1907) was, along with Alphonsus de
        Guimaraens, the highlight of the Symbolist movement in Minas Gerais. The poet, who was born in Ouro Preto, had
        in his poetry the constant presence of the "solitude of the deserts" of Minas Gerais and the "prolonged sunsets"
        of the region, as well as the poet of Ismália. Cruz e Sousa's influence is constantly present - as it was in all
        our Symbolism - but not withdrawing, as Andrade Muricy exemplified in his Panorama of the Brazilian Symbolist
        Movement, the character "of a true poet, with a defined personality".</p>

    <p>As a public figure, he collaborated with the magazine Lótus and the São Paulo newspaper Jornal do Comércio. He
        participated in the literary group "Jardineiros do Ideal", whose importance in the state of Minas Gerais was
        significant, and this value was recognized by Nestor Vítor - Cruz e Sousa's closest friend - when, in 1900,
        Nestor called the group to give a lecture on the most significant poet of our Symbolism.</p>

    <p>About the incident that put an end to a large part of Edgar Mata's work (in the text the spelling is Edgard) and
        which I referred to at the beginning of this topic, Cilene Cunha de Souza tells us a definitive testimony about
        the case: "On August 7, 1921, in the Jornal Minas Gerais, Mario de Lima wrote:
        'What Edgard Mata published constitutes the smallest fraction of his work. Much of this has unfortunately been
        lost. Lost - inadvertently thrown by a venerable lady of the poet's family - in the flames of a stove, dozens of
        precious originals of his verses, almost all unpublished, as he once told me, nonchalantly, as if it were the
        most natural thing in the world.</p>

    <p>Despite the scarcity of his work, his name reached the top echelon of the Modernist movement, being admired,
        among others, by Manuel Bandeira and by the Minas Gerais native Carlos Drummond de Andrade (in Panorama of the
        Symbolist Movement). Poems like "Stalactite" and "I remember this mysterious sunset..." profoundly marked
        generations of readers, even with the publication limited to panoramas and collections on the Symbolist
        movement. On the occasion of his death, he was honored by Mariana Higina with the sonnet "Saudade" - an
        affectionate reminder of the poet's painful and beautiful "Stalactite". He was saved by the oral tradition that
        existed in Minas Gerais, because his poems passed from mouth to mouth through declamation; without such a
        tradition, it is very likely that the codices would not be enough for the memory of Edgar Mata, even if only
        clumsy, to still have a shine.</p>

    <p>I transcribe some poems by this fabulous poet, about whom our recognition still needs to be greater and better
        refined - since the period in which he wrote and in which his poetry still lived fully (between 1896-1920) still
        seems to us as a missing link in our Literature, such a focus given to the Week of Modern Art and its artists.
        Notice how sparse Edgar Mata's punctuation is (what remains of his work was transcribed by the poet's sisters.
        It is not known whether they have preserved the original punctuation of the text in its entirety or whether the
        text found in the codices is full of grammatical typos; On the veracity or otherwise of this characteristic of
        Edgar Mata's poetry, a relative of the poet - and also a bard - wrote, in 1916, that "these poems of his (...),
        as can be seen, are not well punctuated. Edgar always used a very simple punctuation, but not as scarce as this
        one"); in the Panorama of the Brazilian Symbolist Movement, Andrade Muricy even included some semicolons in the
        text in order to arrive at a thematic and textual pattern.</p>
